Each listing is defined by 25 parameters which include information such as District, City, Town, property Type (e.g., Apartment, House, Farm), several area measures (TotalArea, LivingArea, GrossArea, LotSize, BuiltArea), the asking Price in EUR, construction year, energy certificate / efficiency level, parking/garage availability, floor, number of rooms, bathrooms and the date when the listing was published. \n",

    "We assume we are a private real-estate agency operating in Portugal. Private sellers want to list their properties. Many owners are unsure which asking price is reasonable for their property, especially in less familiar regions or for special property types. Our business wants to offer an automatic “price recommendation” product that suggests a realistic price or price range before the listing goes online. Our analytics team also wants to understand which characteristics (location, size, conservation status, energy certificate, etc.) have the strongest impact on price in different regions. \n",

    "Automating processes: By reducing manual labor time spent on price estimation for standard properties, our agents can focus more on complex cases, negotiations and client support \n",

    "The primary data mining goal of this project is to build and evaluate a supervised regression model that predicts the asking price of a property in EUR based on many features and properties available in the dataset (e.g. property type, parking, rooms, area). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal more specifically: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a price prediction model that can estimate the value of a property with reasonably low error. We are going to check that it obviously does better than simple baselines, for example just using the median price. \n",

    "2. Check how stable the model is across different groups, such as cities or property types (apartments vs houses). This will help us later when we look at fairness and potential risks. \n",

    "This data mining success criteria translates our goals into something we can actually measure.  \n",

    "1. Performance compared to simple baselines: The model should beat simple baselines. On a held-out test set, we expect metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to be noticeably better than these baselines. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stability across segments: When we look at the errors for different cities/towns or property types (apartments vs houses), we expect the model to behave reasonably consistently and provide around the same performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interpretability of the visuals: The results (metrics, plots, tables) should be specific enough that we can explain the model behavior and typical errors to non-technical colleagues in the agency. \n",

    "Bias and unfair pricing: The model learns from past listing prices, which may already be biased between regions or property types. It could keep these patterns and suggest systematically lower or higher prices in some areas (or based on any other feature). \n",
    "Automation bias: Agents (the ones using the model) might trust the suggested price too much just because it is from an algorithm. We should treat it as a support tool, not as the final decision. \n",

    "   Limited peer-reviewed literature is available on this specific Portuguese real-estate \n",
    "   listing dataset. However, similar real-estate price prediction tasks typically achieve:\n",
    "   - Standard regression models (Linear/Ridge): R² ≈ 0.75-0.85\n",
    "   - Tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting): R² ≈ 0.90-0.97\n",
    "   - Deep learning approaches: R² > 0.95 (but with added complexity)\n",

    "   Our model vastly outperforms all trivial baselines, achieving {test_mae/mean_baseline_mae:.1f}x \n",
    "   better MAE than the mean predictor. The improvement demonstrates that property features \n",

    "We evaluate our final XGBoost model and analysis against the business success\n",
    "criteria defined in the beginning of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Actionable price recommendations\n",
    "The final model achieves very low prediction errors on the held-out test set\n",
    "(MAE = 0.0264, RMSE = 0.0603, R² = 0.9956 on log-transformed prices), which\n",
    "indicates that it can produce realistic and stable price recommendations for\n",
    "new listings. The predictions can be converted back to the original price\n",
    "scale and used as a starting point for asking-price decisions and for defining\n",
    "reasonable price ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Reduced time spent on manual valuation\n",
    "Once trained, the model can generate price estimates for thousands of\n",
    "listings within seconds (the final test prediction run took about 0.04 seconds\n",
    "in our experiments). This is substantially faster than manual valuation by a\n",
    "human agent and supports the business goal of speeding up the initial pricing\n",
    "step.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Meaningful market insights\n",
    "During the project we performed exploratory analysis and model-based analysis\n",
    "(e.g. feature importance from the tree-based model) to understand which\n",
    "variables drive asking price. These results provide interpretable patterns,\n",
    "such as the impact of location, size and number of bedrooms, which can be\n",
    "communicated to non-technical stakeholders as market insights. This addresses\n",
    "the requirement for well-defined, interpretable findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Consistent quality across segments\n",
    "Overall metrics on the test set suggest strong average performance. However,\n",
    "we note that some segments (e.g. rare property types or sparsely represented\n",
    "regions) may still have higher uncertainty due to limited training data.\n",
    "While the model appears reasonably reliable across the bulk of the data,\n",
    "additional targeted evaluation by district/property type would be advisable\n",
    "before deploying the system in high-stakes settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the current prototype meets the business success criteria at a\n",
    "proof-of-concept level: it provides fast, accurate price recommendations and\n",
    "useful insight into price drivers, with some residual risks in data-sparse\n",

    "5e) Analysis of potential bias and uneven performance across segments\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyse potential bias and uneven performance of the final XGBoost model,\n",
    "we evaluated test errors separately for different segments of the data. We\n",
    "focused on two attributes that are central to the business case: District\n",
    "(geographical region) and Type (property type such as apartment or house).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the held-out test set the global performance of the final model is\n",
    "MAE = 0.0264 and RMSE = 0.2457 (on log-transformed prices). For each district\n",
    "and property type we computed the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared\n",
    "error (RMSE) and median absolute error, and compared these values to the global\n",
    "metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the main, well-represented segments the model behaves quite consistently.\n",
    "For example, apartments (n = 700) have an MAE of 0.0233 (about 0.88x the\n",
    "global MAE) and houses (n = 470) have an MAE of 0.0279 (about 1.06x the global\n",
    "MAE), indicating that the model is slightly better or similar to the global\n",
    "average for the largest property categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, several smaller segments show higher error rates. Among\n",
    "districts, regions such as Ilha de Santa Maria, Faro, Vila Real, Castelo\n",
    "Branco and Ilha de Porto Santo have MAE values roughly 1.6-2.9 times higher\n",
    "than the global MAE, often with relatively few test samples. Among property\n",
    "types, very infrequent categories like \"Other - Commercial\" (n = 1), \"Other -\n",
    "Residential\" (n = 3), \"Land\" (n = 9), \"Hotel\" (n = 1), \"Farm\" (n = 8) and\n",
    "\"Office\" (n = 2) show MAE values between about 2x and 9x the global MAE.\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns suggest that while the model delivers stable performance for\n",
    "the core segments (apartments and houses in common districts), it is\n",
    "significantly less reliable for under-represented districts and rare property\n",
    "types. From a risk perspective, price recommendations for these small segments\n",
    "should be treated with caution, for example by flagging them for manual review,\n",
    "using wider price ranges or collecting additional data before relying on the\n",
    "model in high-stakes decisions. Overall, the analysis indicates no systematic\n",
    "bias against large parts of the market, but highlights specific tail segments\n",
    "where the uncertainty and potential bias are higher.\n",
